# Paper Slider

Vaadin 14 Java integration of @polymer/paper-slider

## Development instructions

JavaScript modules can either be published as an NPM package or be kept as local 
files in your project. The local JavaScript modules should be put in 
`src/main/resources/META-INF/frontend` so that they are automatically found and 
used in the using application.

If the modules are published then the package should be noted in the component 
using the `@NpmPackage` annotation in addition to using `@JsModule` annotation.


Starting the test/demo server:
1. Run `mvn jetty:run`.
2. Open http://localhost:8080 in the browser.

## Publishing to Vaadin Directory

```
mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=1.0.0 # You cannot publish snapshot versions 
mvn install -Pdirectory
```

The package is created as `target/paper-slider-1.0.0.zip`
